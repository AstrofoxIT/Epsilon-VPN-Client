# Epsilon VPN Client

What is it?
------------
The Epsilon VPN Client is an open-source VPN client created in Visual Basic .NET after a lack of VPN clients were found. The client was originally designed for private use for a private business, but the author decided that it an open-source solution was required. And so Epsilon was born.

The program is currently in a beta phase with only the VPN connections (L2TP & PPTP) being active. There are plans to add more features such as credential management and provider specific options in the future. The program will become more suitable for commercial use and can be used in a wide variety of situations ranging from corporate down to consumer level users.
