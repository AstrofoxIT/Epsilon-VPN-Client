# Epsilon VPN Client

What is it?
------------
The Epsilon VPN Client is an open-sourced VPN client created in Visual Basic .NET after a lack of VPN clients were found. The client was originally designed for private use for a private business, but the author decided that it an open-source solution was required. And so Epsilon was born.
